###A synthesis of the ten simple rules format in scientific discourse
<br>

###Purpose  
The primary goal here is to highlight that simple rules in science can strongly inform novice and expert scientists alike and provide a rapid roadmap to advance understanding for a specific topic.  The impact is explored using conventional bibliometric estimates.  Independent of the impact of these contributions to the peer-reviewed literature, this paper format can provide an overview of a topic and function as a mechanism to synthesize evidence.  With the significant volume of scientific resoures available to the community including publications, data, blog posts, texts, vignettes, and technical resources, synthesis tools that succinctly direct, aggregate, and inform readers are increasingly important. 

###Ten simple rules for rules
A summary of the salient elements common across all contributions.  

1. Be useful.
2. Be clear.
3. Provide actionable rules .
4. List the best resources for additional research.
5. Be open.
6. Describe limitations and challenges of the rules provided.
7. Highlight the need within the field for synthesis.
8. Aggregate research and expert knowledge.
9. Be succinct.
10. Provide an outcome.

Contrast this topological assessment across all papers with the specific ten simple rules for simple rules paper. Consider using a checklist to score each and every contribution published to date with the proposed meta-rules (original and these).

###Data
```{r, data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
data <- read_csv("data/ten.simple.rules.scored.csv") #bibliometric returns from the Web of Science on June 25th, 2018

data <- data %>%
  select(title, authors, journal, year, DOI, total.citations, citations.yr, category, views, shares, saves)
data
summary(data)

#PCOMPBIO only
pcomp <- data %>%
  filter(journal == "PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY")
summary(pcomp)
skim(pcomp)

#quick count within categories####
#Categories were assigned to general domains of the scientific process using the abstracts and familiarity with each publication (but not with detailed inspection). A secondary classification was also applicable in many instances, and the assignments provided were the primary focus of the paper - i.e. collaboration in a specific field would be classified as collaboration only using this schema.

cats <- data %>%
  group_by(year, category) %>%
  count()
cats

```


###Viz
```{r, viz, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#all pcombbiol papers####
ggplot(pcomp, aes(year, total.citations)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 3) +
  xlim(c(2005, 2020)) +
  labs(x = "year", y = "total citations per paper")

ggplot(pcomp, aes(as.character(year), citations.yr)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "year", y = "citations per paper per year")

#by category
ggplot(cats, aes(category, n)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "domain classification", y = "number of publications") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,2)) +
  coord_flip() 

ggplot(pcomp, aes(year, total.citations, color = category)) +
  geom_line(size = 3) +
  xlim(c(2005, 2020)) +
  labs(x = "year", y = "total citations per paper", color = "") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired")

ggplot(pcomp, aes(as.character(year), citations.yr, color = category)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "year", y = "citations per paper per year", color = "") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired")


```


###Ideas
1. Uptake in teaching contexts.
2. Presentations and slide decks that are often used to communicate and further share the rules.
3. Secure altmetric measures of performance for each paper, i.e. 22,000 views on a given ten simple rules papers is a significant contribution to the community.
4. Summarize the success of the most 'successful' papers, highlight salient elements across all papers, and do a narrative review of summary of the breadth of the field.
5. Scrape first author data for each publication.  
6. Map countries associated with each contribution.
7. Provide an infographic.
8. Develop a checklist using ten simple rules for rules.

###Observations
1. Currently, there is a total of 99 'ten simple rules' publications with 94 in PCOMPBIO.
2. The first paper in PCOMPBIO was published in 2005, the mean of total citations per instance is 7.3 (median 4), and the mean citations per year per instance is 1.3.  
3. There was peak in citation activity centered around the year 2013 in both total citations and citations per paper.  
4. Ten simple rules publications directly related to computation are very successful in securing citations.  
5. There are nonetheless many categories of ten simple rules contributions that synthesize almost every aspect of the scientific progress from mechanistic details of research to professional development.
